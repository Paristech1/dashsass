SLA & Escalation Indicators

SLA Status: Show whether each ticket is on track, close to breaching SLA, or already overdue. This could be a small icon or color-coded tag next to the ticket status.

Escalation Paths: If a ticket is overdue or nearing its SLA limit, make it easy to escalate to a higher tier or manager right from the dashboard or ticket view.

Ticket Aging & Trends

Aging Buckets: Provide a breakdown of how long tickets have been open (e.g., 0–3 days, 3–7 days, 7+ days). This helps managers quickly see if there’s a backlog growing.

Historical Trends: Graphs or line charts that show whether ticket volume or resolution times are trending up or down over time.

Agent Workload & Efficiency

Workload Distribution: Show how many tickets each agent currently has open or in progress. Great for balancing load.

Resolution Time & SLA Compliance: Track average/median resolution times per agent/team, and how often they meet SLAs.

Intelligent Search & Filters

Unified Search: It looks like you already have a search bar. Make sure it can handle advanced filters (e.g., “status: open + priority: high + assigned to: John Smith”).

Saved Searches or Quick Filters: Let users quickly apply the most common filters (e.g., “my high-priority tickets,” “all overdue tickets”) with one click.

Collaboration & Internal Comments

Internal Comments & @Mentions: Let agents easily @mention teammates in ticket discussions to speed up collaboration.

Internal Chat or Handoff: If your tool supports chat, allow a quick way to escalate or hand off a ticket to another agent or manager.

Customizable Dashboards & Reporting

Configurable Widgets: Make it easy for different roles (managers vs. agents) to rearrange or select which widgets appear on their dashboard.

Export & Schedule Reports: For management, the ability to schedule emailed reports or export data (e.g., CSV or PDF) can be very helpful.

Automation & Macros

Automation Rules: Based on certain triggers (priority, keywords, requestor), automatically assign or route tickets.

Canned Responses / Macros: Let agents insert common responses or solutions quickly, ensuring consistency and saving time.

Accessibility & Mobile Responsiveness

Responsive Layout: Make sure the dashboard elements reflow well on mobile or tablets. Some managers or techs might be looking at tickets on the go.

Keyboard Navigation & Screen Reader Support: Ensuring the platform is accessible for all users can be a big win and sometimes a requirement.

Security & Role-Based Access

Granular Permissions: Different views or actions depending on roles (e.g., agent vs. manager). Some data might be restricted if it’s sensitive.

Audit Logs: A log of critical changes (e.g., reassigning or closing tickets) can be useful for compliance or post-mortem analysis.
